Reverse Bit Order:
The order of the bits of the input data is reversed before including into 
the CRC. This can be useful when CRCs are generated in comms protocols.

Compliment CRC:
The CRC is complimented after completion. Some CRC calculation standards 
require this (HDLC for example). 

Do Checksum Instead:
A checksum is calculated instead of a CRC. Note that if you are using this 
feature to generate a checksum to put into a PDS, a few settings must be 
used to make it correct: 1) the address range must encompass the entire 
program (i.e. include the CRC location). 2) the CRC seed value must be 0.
3) Don’t check ‘Reverse Bit Order’, or ‘Compliment CRC’.
